# CBOR Example using Rust and C

This repository is an example from the blog post on [jaredwolff.com.](#)

## Building the Rust server

Already assuming you have Rust installed ([`rustup`](https://rustup.rs) is recommended)

Then run

```
cargo run
```

This will build and run your server. When ready you'll see:

```
cbor-example on ÓÇ† master [+?] is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.47.0 
‚ùØ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/cbor-example`
```

## Building the C code

This code does use `cmake` please be sure to install before you continue. You should also have `curl` installed.

```
> brew install cmake curl
```

My example above uses [Homebrew for OSX](https://brew.sh). You should install per your OS recommended package manager. 

Once installed

```
> cd client
‚ùØ cmake .

```

Then build it

```
‚ùØ cmake --build .

```

Then run it with:

```
> ‚ùØ ./client 
Start of QCBOR Example
```

You should see an instant response on the other side:

```
Message from id: 1234
Telemetry: TelemetryData { version: "0.1.0", rssi: -49 }
```

Well done! You did it!
